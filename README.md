## Installation
Clone this repository then follow the installation instructions!

If you want to deploy from the command line simply use ``npm i domogami`` in the folder you wish to include the projects files.

Just want the ACTS system and not the whole framework?  Grab the js file from the stable folder or alternatively download it from a CDN.

## Deployment
After following the installation instructions found on the public repository, you will have access to the development working environment for Domogami.  If you are just looking to host a Domogami App then follow these steps.   Otherwise if you intend to contribute to the framework please read our contribution guide.

Domogami can run dynamically from any folder inside your server, but is usually intended to be ran from the main public_html directory with the includes directory placed one step above in the directory scope outside of public access.  If you are running it from a none masked URL or from a file directory certain considerations must be taken into account, those will be detailed later.

The basic structure of a Domogami App comprises of a index.php (html is also supported but takes a specific design flow), a domogami.js script, some modules and process created with php scripts or basic html.
